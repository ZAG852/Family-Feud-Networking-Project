Run the server code followed by client code
You can either login or create new profile
Cannot login if you enter the wrong password or a username that doesn't exist
Cannot create a new profile if the username you enter already exists (password does not matter since this is private)
Login information is compared through the 'password.txt' doc, which must be in the same location as the server
Creating a new profile adds it to this doc, which is written as 'username' \tab 'password'
For checking scores, we can create a new doc that writes usernames followed by score, or something similar
