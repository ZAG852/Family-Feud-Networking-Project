# Family-Feud-Networking-Project
This project mimics the old classic family feud game with networking capabilities to be played in a server-client fashion.
The server is set to be the localhost. There is no team functionality but you can check your score and stuff. Made with my classmates
for a school project. Credit given within each file.
